Perl6/Tokener version 0.01
============================

This is the first version of the Perl 6 tokener. There are known bugs,
which will soon be addressed. However, this much is enough to allow you
to start writing a parser. And that's gotta rock.

SYNOPSIS
           use Perl6::Tokener;
           my $t = new Perl6::Tokener(file=>"foo.pl", buffer => $code);
           while ($t->{buffer}) {
               my ($type, $token) = $t->toke();
               ...
           }

DESCRIPTION
       I don't think there's really much I need to say about
       this. It isn't perfect, but I'm working on it. The synop-
       sis pretty much gives you all you need to know to drive
       the thing, and, bluntly, if you're futzing with tokenising
       Perl 6, you're already beyond the need for most kinds of
       documentation. So have fun.

       Oh, one thing - when you're parsing, you probably want to
       discard the type of everything called "operator" or "term"
       and just use the token value. Oh, and white space will
       return "undef" for token and type, so don't try using this
       in a "while" loop.
